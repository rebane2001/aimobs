# AIMobs
AIMobs is a mod that lets you chat or talk (hold R key) with Minecraft mobs and other entities by creating prompts and using the OpenAI API.

### Requirements
- Minecraft 1.19.4
- Fabric
- Fabric API 0.86.1.19.4
- Java 17 [here](https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=17)
- (Prism Launcher [here](https://prismlauncher.org))

### Installation
[YouTube Tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCaTp5a8ZU)

### Usage
After installing the mod, grab your OpenAI API key from [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys), and set it with the `/aimobs setkey <key>` command. Also in order to let the mobs talk to you: First enable the Cloud Text-to-Speech API - [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/texttospeech.googleapis.com) and then create your API key credential [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Once you have it, set it with the `/aimobs setvoicekey <voicekey>` command

You should now be able to **talk to mobs by shift+clicking** on them!

### Notes
This project was initially made in 1.12 as a client Forge mod, then ported to 1.19 PaperMC as a server plugin, then ported to Fabric 1.19. Because of this, the code can be a little messy and weird. A couple hardcoded limits are 512 as the max token length and 4096 as the max prompt length (longer prompts will get the beginning cut off), these could be made configurable in the future.

Some plans for the future:  
- Support for the Forge modloader.
- Support for other AI APIs.

An unofficial community-made fork is available with support for Ukranian and EspaÃ±ol at [Eianex/aimobs](https://github.com/Eianex/aimobs/releases).
